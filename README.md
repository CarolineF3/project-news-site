I love ballet and ballet aesthetics so I decided to create a ballet news site. 

I probably didn't plan ahead as much as I should have. I didn't run into any major problems, but I'm very much a beginner so I had to google everything over and over again. It was very time consuming. I got some input from my boyfriend and from the members of my team but I mostly worked on my own, just trying to get a grasp of everything. I installed Beautify, which was a great help.

I'm quite pleased by the appearence of my site but I'm unsure about the quality of the code.
